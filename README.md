# Lambda-Understanding

The easiest way to understand C++11's new features is by trying to understand how a "Lambda" function works. In this project , we will serially build from older style "function objects" to finally start having "lambda" like capabilities.

By doing this we get an intro into :

1) Lambda syntax and usage
2) Variadic templates and tuple.
3) initializer list
4) auto type deduction

Refer the examples in this order : 

[first step : Lambda.h](https://github.com/SKashyap/Lambda-Understanding/blob/master/Lambda.h)

[second step : LambdaPart2/h](https://github.com/SKashyap/Lambda-Understanding/blob/master/LambdaPart2.h)
